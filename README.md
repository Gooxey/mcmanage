# MCManage

This application is aiming to make the creation and management of [Minecraft servers](https://www.minecraft.net/) as easy as possible.

## Disclaimer

This project is still in very early development.

## Features

- Starts Minecraft servers configured in the `config/server_list.json` file ( The Minecraft server must be stored under `servers/<the name of the server>` )
- Restarts all Minecraft servers every 24h
- Stores the logs of each server under `logs/<the name of the server>.txt`

## Configuration

In the future, you can use this application fully via a website hosted by this application, but for now, the use of files for configuration is unavoidable.#

There are many files generated by this application, but the only ones YOU should edit are the ones stored inside the `config/` folder. Each name pretty much sums up what it is for, and if you make a mistake, it will be either corrected or an example file will be created.

The `servers` folder can also be modified since it is the one storing all Minecraft servers.

## Install

To install this application, you need [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Next, just run the following command:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
    # a lot of lines saying `Compiling ...`
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 52.03s
```

After that, you will be able to get the executable from `./target/release/mcmanage.exe`
